# CS-320

Through out this course as a software developer we created a program with Junit testing which inculded classes such as contact service files (Contact.java, ContactService.java, ContactTest.java, ContactServiceTest.java) and ran the Junit test in the back to see how efficent it was. Also having more then one person view and teast the code you build is a likely to give you the best result. As in just yourself you can over look small mistakes.
